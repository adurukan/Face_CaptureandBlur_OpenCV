# Face_CaptureandBlur_OpenCV
Capturing the face constantly through a webcam and blurring it.

Once the code is ran, a screen pops up that shows the your face with a red rectangle around it. Please look directly at the camera when you run the script since it needs to detect your face. If it cannot detect the face in the first instant, please re-run the code. 
There are various other tracking algorithms that can be applied which vary in quality in terms of accuracy and speed.
